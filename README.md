### How to get Google Credential File or Private key file

In order to connect to Dialogflow, this app requires a following credentials from Dialogflow.

    1. Project Id
    2. Client email
    3. Private Key

You can find all these credentials in a JSON file, which u can get from [here](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/quick/setup#sa-create). Under `Create a service account and download the private key file` section there, you will find detailed instruction about how to get the JSON file. After obtaining this JSON file, you can proceed to the next section.


### Rocket.Chat Apps Setup

1. First go ahead n create a Bot User. Login as administrator, then goto `Setting > Users`. There create a new Bot User. This new user should have these 2 roles.</br>
    1. bot
    2. livechat-agent

2. Then configure the app to automatically assign a livechat-visitor to this bot. To do so, goto `Setting > Livechat > Routing` or `Setting > Omnichannel > Routing`. There enable `Assign new conversations to bot agent` Setting.

3. The app needs some configurations to work, so to setup the app Go to `Setting > Apps > Dialogflow`. There, fill all the necessary fields in `SETTINGS` and click SAVE. Note all fields are required.

    Some of the fields in `SETTING` include
    1. Bot Username (required)
        - This should contain the same bot username which we created above in Step 1
    2. Project Id (required)
        - This corresponds to `project_id` property of the Google Credentials File obtained from `Rocket.Chat Apps Setup` section above
    3. Client Email (required)
        - This corresponds to `client_email` property of the Google Credentials File obtained from `Rocket.Chat Apps Setup` section above
    4. Private Key (required)
        - This corresponds to `private_key` property of the Google Credentials File obtained from `Rocket.Chat Apps Setup` section above.
        - Kindly note that this value will be very long. So please take extra care while copy/paste.
    5. Fallback Responses Limit (optional)
        - The app will automatically trigger handover if consecutive `fallback` intents are triggered `N` no of times. This setting defines this value `N`.
        - Eg. Suppose the bot is not able to answer visitor's consecutive 3 answers, and this setting threshold is `3`. In such case, the app will trigger an handover to an online agent on its own.
        - To Deactivate this feature, simply set the value to `0`.
    6. Target Department for Handover (optional)
        - Enter the department name where you want the visitor to be transferred upon handover.
    7. Handover Message (optional)
        - The Bot will send this message to Visitor upon handover
    8. Service Unavailable Message (optional)
        - The Bot will send this message to Visitor if service is unavailable like suppose if no agents are online.
    9. Close Chat Message (optional)
        - This message will be sent automatically when a chat is closed
    10. Hide Quick Replies (required)
        - If enabled, then all quick-replies will hide when a visitor clicks on any one of them
    11. Send Welcome Intent (required)
        - If enabled, then a welcome event will be sent to bot, when the bot is assigned to any visitor

4. (Optional Step) Lastly you can test your Dialogflow Connection by viewing App Logs. To view the logs, goto App Page (`Setting > Apps > Dialogflow`). There click on menu item (3 vertical dots icon) and then select `View Logs`. There select the **most recent** `onSettingUpdated` title. If you see `------------------ Google Credentials validation Success ----------------` message, then it means your setup is fine. If you don't see this message, then recheck your Dialogflow credentials.

### Dialogflow's API

The app provides API to trigger specific actions. The URL for the API can be found on the Apps Page(`Setting > Apps > Dialogflow`). Currently the app provides 2 APIs.

    This endpoint can be used to trigger specific actions. The list of supported actions include
    1. **Close Chat**<br/>
        To close a chat
        - REST API Documentation for this endpoint can be found [here](./docs/api-endpoints/close-chat.md)
